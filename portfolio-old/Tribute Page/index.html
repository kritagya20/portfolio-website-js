                    Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as ‘MS Dhoni’  was born in a middle-class Rajput family on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Jharkhand (then in Bihar).
                    His father, Pan Singh, was an employee at MECON. His mother, Devki Devi, is a homemaker. 
                    He completed his schooling at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir in Shyamali, Ranchi. 
                    During his school days, he used to play badminton and football. He played as a goalkeeper in a local football team. 
                    Watching his eye-catchy skills, his football coach sent him to a local cricket club to play cricket. 
                    He never played cricket before but he managed to grab the concept perfectly. 
                    His wicket-keeping skills amazed everyone in the club. 
                    He was appointed as the wicketkeeper for the local team on a regular basis. 
                    Later, he started to focus primarily on cricket and left his glory days of football and badminton behind. 
                    It was a drastic change in his life. He started to take professional coaching after Class X. 
                    He was also a meritorious student and teachers respected him for his versatile nature. 
                    He used to manage his studies and sports sessions perfectly. His family was very supportive of his ambitions.

                    He was selected as the U-19 Bihar cricket squad member in 1998-99. 
                    When he was 18 years old, he played the first match in Ranji Trophy for Bihar and scored a half-century. 
                    Just after 5 years, his skills caught the eyes of team selectors of the Indian national cricket team. 
                    His excellent performance and a century for the East Zone helped the team to clinch the Deodhar Trophy. 
                    His 60 runs also helped his team to clinch the Duleep Trophy. 
                    As time passed, he joined Indian Railways as a Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) in Midnapore District, West Bengal in 2000. 
                    He was very honest. He also had a mischievous side. 
                    He once dressed as ghosts with his friends and scared the night guards patrolling the railway quarters. 
                    He eventually became better in his cricketing skills. 
                    His performance in the Triangular Tournament held in Kenya against Pakistan. 
                    This christened him with a new name ‘clinical destroyer’ of commendable bowling attacks. 
                    PC Poddar, the Bengal captain back in the 60s, identified his skills and immediately called the National Cricket Academy.

                    Dhoni was named vice-captain of the ODI team for the series against South Africa and England. 
                    In June 2007, Dhoni received an A Grade contract from the BCCI.

                    In September 2007, Dhoni shared a record with his idol Adam Gilchrist-- most dismissals in an innings in ODI. <br>

                    In the first season of IPL (Indian Premier League), Dhoni was contracted by the Chennai Super Kings for US$1.5 million, becoming the most expensive player in the first season auctions. Under his captaincy, the team won 2010, 2011 and 2018 IPL titles. The team also won 2010 and 2014 Champions League T20 titles. <br>

                    In 2011, Dhoni-led India to the finals with a victory over Australia in the quarter-finals and Pakistan in the finals. 
                    Dhoni helped India win by chasing a target of 275 against Sri Lanka in the finals with Gautam Gambhir and Yuvraj Singh. Dhoni finished the match with a historical six with a score of 91*. He bagged Man of the Match for his outstanding performance in the 2011 Cricket World Cup. <br>

                    India lost the series by 1-2. 

                    In 2013, India won ICC Champions Trophy and Dhoni became the first and the only captain in the history of cricket to claim all the ICC trophies. 
                    In the same year, he became the second India batsman after Sachin Tendulkar to score 1,000 or more ODI runs against Australia. <br>

                    During 2013-14, India toured South Africa and New Zealand but lost both the series. 
                    In 2014, India won the ODI series in England by 3-1 and in India by 2-1 against West Indies. 
                    In 2014, ICC named him as the captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' for the T20 World Cup. <br>

                    During the 2015 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni became the first Indian captain to win all group stage matches in such a tournament. 
                    Despite a great start in the 2015 Cricket World Cup, India lost the title to the eventual champions-- Australia. <br>

                    In January 2017, Dhoni stepped down as the captain of the Indian team in all the limited-over formats. 
                    In the ODI home series against England, he scored well and was named as a wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' at the 2017 Champions Trophy and ODI XI of the year by Cricbuzz. 
                    In the same year, during the ODI against Sri Lanka, he became the first wicket-keeper to effect 100 stumpings.  <br>

                    In the 2014-15 season, Dhoni played his last test series against Australia and captained the second and third test matches. Dhoni announced his retirement from the Test format, following the third test in Melbourne. In his last test match, Dhoni effected nine dismissals and broke Kumar Sangakkara record for stumpings with 134 in all the formats. <br>

                    Dhoni was again contracted by CSK and led the team to win the third IPL title. 
                    In 2019, he again captained for CSK and the team emerged to be one of the strongest in the season. 
                    However, Mumbai Indians won the title. <br>


                    In the 2019 Cricket World Cup, Dhoni was selected for the Indian team. 
                    Dhoni played well against South Africa, Australia and West Indies but was criticised for his strike rate against Afghanistan and England.
                    In the semi-finals against New Zealand, Dhoni scored a half-century in the second innings but was run out at a very crucial stage. With his dismissal, India's World Cup run ended. <br>

            <dl>
                <dt>Kapil Dev :</dt>
                <dd>MS Dhoni is my hero. We talk a lot about Sachin Tendulkar, Virender Sehwag. But this boy has much talent then anyone else.</dd>

                <dt>Rahul Dravid :</dt>
                <dd>One of the things I liked about MS was, what you saw was what you got. Very uncomplicated, always led by example. One of the things I really liked about playing under MS was that he never asked you to do anything that he himself didn't do.</dd>
                
                <dt>Sachin Tendulkar :</dt>
                <dd>Dhoni is the best captain I have played under. He always tried to be a step ahead of the opposition. </dd>
                            
                <dt>Gary Kirsten :</dt>
                <dd>I would go to war with Dhoni by my side.</dd>

                <dt>Adam Gilchrist :</dt>
                <dd> MS is not the next Gilchrist, he is the first MS Dhoni.</dd>

                <dt>Sourav Ganguly :</dt>
                <dd>I had over the years constantly looked out for players who remain steady under pressure and possess the capability to change the course of the match. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who came to my notice in 2004, was a natural progression of this thought. I wish I'd Dhoni in my 2003 World Cup team. I was told that when we were playing the 2003 World Cup final he was still a ticket collector with Indian Railways. Unbelievable!</dd>
                
                <dt>Sunil Gavaskar :</dt>
                <dd>When I die the last thing I want to see is the six that Dhoni hit in the 2011 World Cup final.</dd>

                <dd> For being a good captain, there are two important qualities. Tactically you have to be very good which Dhoni is. He understood the strengths and weakness of the players he was playing with even when he did not captain;, especially with the bowlers. Second, is man-management skills. As captain, you want to be consistent. Dhoni is very good because he has been very balanced and equanimous irrespective of the loss or a win and that makes him very special.</dd>

                <dd>Dhoni has respect for all other playing nations. I had found him to be a really strong leader.</dd>
