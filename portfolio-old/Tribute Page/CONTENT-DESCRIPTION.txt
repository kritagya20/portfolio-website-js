STORY

							EARLY LIFE
	Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as ‘MS Dhoni’  was born in a middle-class Rajput family on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, Jharkhand (then in Bihar). His 	father, Pan Singh, was an employee at MECON. His mother, Devki Devi, is a homemaker.He completed his schooling at DAV 	Jawahar Vidya Mandir in Shyamali, Ranchi. During his school days, he used to play badminton and football. He played as a goalkeeper in a local football team.Watching his eye-catchy skills, his football coach sent him to a local cricket club to play cricket. He never played cricket before but he managed to grab the concept perfectly. His wicket-keeping skills amazed everyone in the club. He was appointed as the wicketkeeper for the local team on a regular basis. Later, he started to focus primarily on cricket and left his glory days of football and badminton behind.

As time passed, he joined Indian Railways as a Train Ticket Examiner (TTE) in Midnapore District, West Bengal in 2000. He was very honest. He also had a mischievous side.
